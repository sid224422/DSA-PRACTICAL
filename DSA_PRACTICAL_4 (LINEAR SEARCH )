# a)Write a Python program to store roll numbers of student in array who attended training
program in random order. Write function for searching whether particular student attended
training program or not, using linear search and Sentinel search.
b)Write a Python program to store roll numbers of student array who attended
training program in sorted order. Write function for searching whether particular
student attended training program or not, using Binary search and Fibonacci search

#To search whether particulat student attended the program or not 

#USING LINEAR SEARCH
